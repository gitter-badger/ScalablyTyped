  /**
    * Creates a widget decoration, which is a DOM node that's shown in
    * the document at the given position. It is recommended that you
    * delay rendering the widget by passing a function that will be
    * called when the widget is actually drawn in a view, but you can
    * also directly pass a DOM node. getPos can be used to find the
    * widget's current document position.
    *
    * @param spec These options are supported:
    * @param spec.side Controls which side of the document position
    * this widget is associated with. When negative, it is drawn before
    * a cursor at its position, and content inserted at that position
    * ends up after the widget. When zero (the default) or positive, the
    * widget is drawn after the cursor and content inserted there ends
    * up before the widget.
    *
    * When there are multiple widgets at a given position, their side
    * values determine the order in which they appear. Those with lower
    * values appear first. The ordering of widgets with the same side
    * value is unspecified.
    *
    * When marks is null, side also determines the marks that the widget
    * is wrapped in—those of the node before when negative, those of
    * the node after when positive.
    * @param spec.marks The precise set of marks to draw around the widget.
    * @param spec.stopEvent Can be used to control which DOM events, when
    * they bubble out of this widget, the editor view should ignore.
    * @param spec.key When comparing decorations of this type (in order to
    * decide whether it needs to be redrawn), ProseMirror will by default
    * compare the widget DOM node by identity. If you pass a key, that key
    * will be compared instead, which can be useful when you generate
    * decorations on the fly and don't want to store and reuse DOM nodes.
    * Make sure that any widgets with the same key are interchangeable—if
    * widgets differ in, for example, the behavior of some event handler,
    * they should get different keys.
